# Project Setup

This provides a most basic compiling and bundling setup for Frontend.
The setup uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) for zero configuration setup.

## Usage

```bash
npm i
```

Parcel has a development server built in, which will automatically rebuild your app as you make changes.

```bash
npm start
```
